# Succedo

> Life is a series of interruptions.

Succedo helps to cope with that by keeping track of the storm of ideas, tasks, and appointments.
There is a mobile app for note input and reminders.
There is a web app for organizing everything.
And maybe there will also be a desktop app which can work independently without a remote database.


## Research

The implementation of Succeedo is inspirired by the following concepts:

- Lean
- GTD
- The Power of Habit


## Alternatives

There are hundreds of other programs for task and note management.
If Succedo is not what you need or want, then you e.g. might want to have a look at those:
